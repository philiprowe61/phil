'''make''' - Compile package in current directory using a rockspec.

== Usage ==

:'''[[luarocks]] make  <nowiki>[</nowiki>--pack-binary-rock<nowiki>]</nowiki>  <nowiki>[</nowiki>''rockspec''<nowiki>]</nowiki>'''

Builds sources in the current directory, but unlike [[build]],
it does not fetch sources, etc., assuming everything is
available in the current directory. After the build is complete, it
also installs the rock.

If no argument is given, it looks for a rockspec in the current directory
(like the ''make'' command does with Makefiles). If more than one rockspec is found, you must specify which to use, through the command-line.

If --pack-binary-rock is passed, the rock is not installed; instead, a .rock file with the contents of compilation is produced in the current directory.

== Example ==

 luarocks make
