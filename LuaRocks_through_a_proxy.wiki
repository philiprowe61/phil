LuaRocks performs network access through helper applications: curl (on Mac OSX) or wget (on other platforms). Both of them use the same method to configure proxies: the http_proxy and ftp_proxy environment variables.

Additionally, a ''proxy'' value must be added to config.lua:

  proxy = "http://server:1234"


== Environment variable example ==

On Unix systems, you can set the ''http_proxy'' environment variable like this:

 export http_proxy=http://server:1234

On Windows systems, the command syntax is:

 set http_proxy=http://server:1234
