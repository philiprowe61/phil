LuaRocks is a command-line tool. You can install LuaRocks using one of the third-party package managers available for OS X, or you may install it manually, in the Unix way.

== Option 1: using Homebrew ==

One option is to use [https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew Homebrew]. If you don't have it installed, follow its [https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/installation installation instructions].

If you already have it installed, make sure it is up to date so you pick the most recent version of LuaRocks:

   brew update

and then install Lua - by default Lua comes with LuaRocks. You can install Lua with:

   brew install lua

== Option 2: installing it manually ==

If you do not wish to use a package management tool to install LuaRocks, you can install it on OS X as you would do in any other Unix system. Download the Unix tarball and then follow the [[Installation instructions for Unix|installation instructions for Unix]] to install it to /usr/local.

== Next steps ==

Once LuaRocks is installed, learn more about [[Using LuaRocks|using LuaRocks]].
