A '''rock''' is a bundle containing a specification file (called a "rockspec") and files providing Lua modules.

A '''[[Rockspec format|rockspec]]''' is a Lua file contaning a series of assignments to variables that provide various information about the rock, such as description metadata, dependency relations and build rules. Rocks are created from rockspecs.

When packed, a rock is an archive file in ZIP format, with the .rock filename extension. When installed, a rock is unpacked into a directory in the local rocks repository.

There are several types of rocks, and when packed they are identified by their filename extensions. These are:

* Source rocks (<tt>.src.rock</tt>): these contain the rockspec and the source code for the Lua modules provided by the rock. When installing a source rock, the source code needs to be compiled.
* Binary rocks (<tt>''.system-arch''.rock</tt>: <tt>.linux-x86.rock, .macosx-powerpc.rock</tt>): these contain the rockspec and modules in compiled form. Modules written in Lua may be in source .lua format, but modules compiled as C dynamic libraries are compiled to their platform-specific format.
* Pure-Lua rocks (<tt>.all.rock</tt>): these contain the rockspec and the Lua modules they provide in .lua format. These rocks are directly installable without a compilation stage and are platform-independent.
