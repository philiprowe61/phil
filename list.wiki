'''list''' - Lists currently installed rocks.

== Usage ==

:'''[[luarocks]] list <nowiki>[</nowiki>''query''<nowiki>]</nowiki>'''

''query'' is a substring of a rock name to filter by. When no arguments are supplied, a list of all rocks you have installed is returned.

The [[list]] command queries the local repository (the rocks you have installed). To query remote repositories (the rocks available for download at the LuaRocks server), use [[search]].

== Example ==

 luarocks list
