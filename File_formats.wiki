These pages are the reference specification for file formats used by LuaRocks. All files are actual Lua files, but they are loaded in a restricted environment in which the standard Lua libraries are not available.

* [[Rockspec_format.wiki|Rockspec format]] - Rockspecs are the files which contain rules explaining how rocks are built and installed as well as their dependencies and other metadata.
* [[Config_file_format.wiki|Config file format]] - The specification of the LuaRocks configuration file format, as it takes shape.
* [[Manifest_file_format.wiki|Manifest file format]] - The index file that describes a LuaRocks [[Rocks_repositories.wiki|repository]], used by both rocks servers and rocks trees.
