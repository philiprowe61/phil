== Downloading ==

Download LuaRocks [https://luarocks.github.io/luarocks/releases here].

Current release is '''2.4.2''': see the [[Release history|release history]].

== Installing ==

* [[Installation instructions for Unix]] (Linux, BSDs, etc.)
* [[Installation instructions for Mac OS X]]
* [[Installation instructions for Windows]]

LuaRocks is a pure Lua application with no library dependencies. Its current release depends on some helper tools, but you shouldn't worry about them, as they are shipped by default on most Unix systems. For Windows, the all-in-one package already includes them and a binary of Lua, as a convenience.

Once LuaRocks is installed, make sure to read the [[Documentation]] for more information!
