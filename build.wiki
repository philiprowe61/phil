'''build''' - Build/compile and install a rock.

== Usage ==

:'''[[luarocks]] build <nowiki>[</nowiki>--pack-binary-rock<nowiki>]</nowiki> {''rockspec'' | ''rock'' | ''name'' <nowiki>[</nowiki>''version''<nowiki>]</nowiki>}'''

Builds and installs a rock, compiling its C parts if any. Argument may be a rockspec file, a source rock file or the name of a rock to be fetched from a repository. Argument may be the name of a rock to be fetched from a server or a filename of a locally available rock or rockspec. In case of more than one rock matching the request, the "build" command favors source rocks.

If --pack-binary-rock is passed, the rock is not installed; instead, a .rock file with the contents of compilation is produced in the current directory.

== Example ==

 luarocks build luasocket
